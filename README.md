## Overview

In this project, Today we will explore a data set dedicated to the cost of treatment of  **different patients**.
The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence, age and so on. 
We have no data on the diagnosis of patients. But we have other information that can help us to make a conclusion about the health of patients and practice regression analysis.
Several models will be trained to predict the medical charges. 
We will compare these results and choose the optimum model.

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.9** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
